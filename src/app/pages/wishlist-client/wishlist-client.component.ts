      description: `Curvy Riae is a 5’2 model with a large number of colourful tattoos – which she shows off in many of her barely-there outfits.
      In one cheeky shot, she leans forward on her hands and knees in front of the washing machine
      She captioned the snap: “Things you can do at home: find the lost socks in the washing machine.”
      The model, who tells fans to be “proud of your weirdness” has a massive 3.1 million followers.
      And many were blown away by the saucy shot.
      One said: “I really hate doing that s***... but have to say you make it look fun!”
      While another joked: “And this is the reason why I can't open my phone on public.” less...`,
    };
